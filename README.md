## IMPORTANT!

## Accessing Admin Pages

To access the **create, edit, and delete** pages, you must be logged in with an administrator account. These pages are not visible to regular users in the menu.

If you have an admin account, you must manually access the following pages by entering their URLs in the browser's address bar:

### **Dishes**
- Create: `/Dishes/Create`
- Edit: `/Dishes/Edit/{id}`
- Delete: `/Dishes/Delete/{id}`

### **Drinks**
- Create: `/Drinks/Create`
- Edit: `/Drinks/Edit/{id}`
- Delete: `/Drinks/Delete/{id}`

If you are not logged in, these commands will not work!  
However, you will still be able to see the created items by accessing the corresponding pages via the navbar.

The language used in this project is Romanian.
